          Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The
          first installment in the Toy Story franchise, it was the first

        <p>
          Following the success of their 1988 short film Tin Toy, Pixar was
          approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film told
          from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote
          early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the
          film's tone to be "edgier".
